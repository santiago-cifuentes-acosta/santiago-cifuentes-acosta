## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a data analyst with experience working with Python, Excel, SQL and Power BI.

I'm currently completing a data analyst internship with Amdari.io, in which I and other interns are engaging in six projects using different tools. Some of these projects are individual, and some are in groups, but all require sharp attention to detail and agility with the tools at hand. 

While I do that, I am gaining familiarity with AI tools like Orange to aid me in the process.

I studied Social and Cultural Anthropology in Brunel University London and I have a Master's in Digital Society from the University of Glasgow. 
This experience with the social sciences gives me an additional critical eye for interpreting statistics, and the ability to situate them in social dinamics to better understand their impact.
