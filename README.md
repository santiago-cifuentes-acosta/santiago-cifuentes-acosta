## Hi there 👋
I am a data analyst with experience working with Python, Excel, SQL and Power BI.

I'm currently completing a data analyst internship with Amdari.io, in which I and other interns are engaging in six projects using different tools. Some of these projects are individual, and some are in groups, but all require sharp attention to detail and agility with the tools at hand. 

While I do that, I am gaining familiarity with AI tools like Orange to aid me in the process.

I studied Social and Cultural Anthropology and I have a Master's in Digital Society.
